    <p class="text-muted"> In early 1957, Archbishop Olçomendy purchased a 5-acre plot of land in the Serangoon Garden Estate.

      Originally planned to house British military forced based in Singapore, the area housed around 15,000 people back in the 1950s. This land would have the Church as well as a primary school managed by the Infant Jesus Sisters.
      
      After the land in Serangoon Garden was purchased, Father Philippe Meisonnier was appointed to take charge of the church building efforts. Together with members of the Church building committee, Father Meisonnier wasted no time, visiting the people every evening with his trademark fabric bag slung on his shoulders, to make personal appeals for funds to build the church.</p>

      <p class="text-muted"> A well stocked library is open to the pupils on all class days. It is also supplied with periodicals and magazines and is a veritable treasure house of reference books and encyclopedias. Each class is given a library period where the students are to read the books and make review of them.

        The reading of books is conducive to the formation of good mind and it is a source of general knowledge.</p>

      <p class="text-muted"> The stage has always been held in great honour at St. Xavier’s. For an educational institution an auditorium is not just a venue for school or college events, or merely a meeting place, it is a space where a corporation of students and scholars congregate – to celebrate, to debate, to discuss, and sometimes even to mourn collectively. As we stand at the threshold of another century in the history of St. Xavier’s College, it is meet that we go down memory lane and find out how students gathered here when it all began 130 odd years ago, how this place changed over the century, and how it is now poised to provide a space for even greater creative, cultural and social events, something that St. Xavier’s College has always been noted for. </p>

      <p> On 29th Nov. 2019, St. Xavier’s College (Autonomous), Mumbai, organized a DBT-CTEP funded day-long science fair to showcase the undergraduate research work being done in college and the opportunities in science. More than 200 school and junior college students and accompanying teachers from South Mumbai (as also students from St Xavier’s itself, from the Arts faculty) visited the exhibition and were enthralled by the exhibits put up by the science students, and by the presence of science in day-to-day life in particular. Students of the Department of Zoology under Dr Sujata Deshpande decided to showcase the Foldscope as an educational and research tool. The stall was very well visited by the guests and was also appreciated by Dr Garima Gupta, Scientist E, DBT. 5 Foldscopes were gifted to the participating schools as a token of encouragemnet to inculcate scientific curiosity. A few glimpses.
